"""Ranking validity of one evaluated episode (08 H1.5).

An episode is rankable when it will be measured, not merely when it ran: its ground-truth pose
must move like a robot, its recording must reach a terminal outcome without lost sections, and
the stream every episode metric needs must exist. Every defect is published as
``is_valid_for_ranking = false`` with the ``invalid_episode:<why>`` token of
:data:`arena_evaluation.storage.declarations.INVALID_EPISODE_REASONS`; a valid episode carries
NULL, so analyses can filter on the flag and report the reasons they excluded.
